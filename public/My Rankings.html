<h1>My Favourite Games of All Time</h1>
<h2>Top 3</h2>

<hr />
<h3>Sonic Unleashed</h3>
<p>This will probably be my favourite game of all time for the rest of my life</p>

<h3>Sonic Generations</h3>
<p>Just as good as Sonic Unleahsed gameplay wise, but is lacking in the music and art direction compared to Unleashed</p>

<h3>The Last of Us Part 1</h3>
<p>The first time I played this game was amazing. I actually cried during the credits, 
because of the story and how it worked with the gameplay</p>
